## What is refine?
**refine** is a React-based framework for the rapid ✨ development of web applications. 
It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by **CRUD** operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts like **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

**refine** is *headless by design* offering unlimited styling and customization options. 



## What do you mean by "headless" ?
Instead of being a limited set of pre-styled components, **refine** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. They are all decoupled from your *UI components* and *business logic*, so they never keep you from customizing your *UI* or coding your own flow.

**refine** seamlessly works with any **custom design** or **UI framework you favor**. For convenience, it ships with ready-made integrations for [Ant Design System](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Use cases
**refine** shines on *data-intensive* applications like *admin panels*, *dashboards* and *internal tools*. Thanks to built-in **SSR support**, **refine** can also power *customer-facing* applications like *storefronts*.
