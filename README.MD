## Quick Start

To use superplate, make sure you have _npx_ is installed on your system (npx is shipped by default since npm 5.2.0).

To create a new app without using presets, run the following command:

```bash
npx superplate-cli <my-project>
```

You will be prompted with plugin options to create your project. A full list of avaiable plugins is here: [superplate-core-plugins](https://github.com/pankod/superplate-core-plugins).


Once all questions are answered, superplate will install all plugins and dependencies. Then navigate to the project folder and launch it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Use the dev command when running application in development mode.


## Documentation

## Philosophy

-   It provides an easy starting to your project by leveraging industry-standard best practices and and performance oriented tools.
-   Fully extensible due its plugin based architechture.
-   Code examples are added to plugin documents to show how best practices are implemented.



## Plugins

superplate uses a plugin-based architecture. Basically, plugins are created from popular npm tools with configuration files. You can check them out in [superplate-core-plugins](https://github.com/pankod/superplate-core-plugins).

The default core plugins determined by <a href="https://www.pankod.com">Pankod</a> team. Feel free to send PR or open an issue for new plugins you want to add.

### Using a custom source of plugins

You can use different sources for plugins other than [superplate-core-plugins](https://github.com/pankod/superplate-core-plugins).

Simply add `--source <path-to-source>` option to use **superplate** with a custom source.
